# ☀️ AI-Driven Solar Energy Forecasting using LSTM

An intelligent solar energy forecasting and optimization dashboard powered by **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** models. This project analyzes solar energy data, predicts future values, compares model performance (LSTM vs. Persistence), and offers actionable insights for efficiency improvements.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🔮 **LSTM-based Solar Forecasting** (Voltage, Current, Efficiency)
- 📊 Interactive Dashboard with **Chart.js Visualizations**
- ⚡ Performance Comparison: **LSTM vs. Persistence Model**
- 💰 Cost & Accuracy Analysis across Sampling Frequencies
- 🧠 AI Insights on Model Improvements
- 🌐 Flask-Powered Backend with Real-Time Data Display

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5, Chart.js
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Modeling**: LSTM (Keras/TensorFlow), Persistence Baseline
- **Visualization**: Chart.js (Bar, Line, Pie, Gauge)
- **Data**: Time-Series Solar Energy Dataset (Custom or MNRE)
